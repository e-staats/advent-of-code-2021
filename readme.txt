Here are my 2021 Advent of Code solutions. I'm using the puzzles this year as a
way to learn C as well as work on my Python, so some problems may be solved with
C and some may be solved with Python. If I have enough time, I'll add solutions
for all of them in both.

The C solutions were compiled with gcc.
